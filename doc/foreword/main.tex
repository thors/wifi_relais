\section*{Foreword}
I looked for a way to replace the timer in my kitchen oven, since an oriinal part would have cost 200€. I decided to use the ESP2866 together with a relais-card and some cheap peripherals and a small web-app to set the timer, all together for ~10€. Since I didn't have any experience with any of the components, the project is broken up in several steps. At least the first steps (up to the point to build a WiFi-controlled relais) is hopefully generic enough to serve as an example to people trying to familiarize themselves with the ESP2866.

At some points I hit some challenges and wrote down the solution to those as well. Hope it helps.
